    o GNU tar 1.27.1

        The Retools tar patch is only applicable against version 1.27.1.

    o Lustre API library

    o Libgcrypt library (optional but required for tar hashing support)

        Tested with libgcrypt 1.4.5.

    o Libgpg-error library (optional but required for tar hashing support)

        Tested with libgpg-error 1.7.


2. Preparation

    Retools is created by applying each included patch to an unpacked
    standard distribution of the corresponding tool.  This is done via
    the "patch" command as shown below with the expected output for
    each.

    2.1. bzip2

        cd bzip2-1.0.6
        patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/bzip2-1.0.6.patch

            patching file LICENSE
            patching file Makefile
            patching file bzip2.c

    2.2. gzip

        cd gzip-1.6
        patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/gzip-1.6.patch

            patching file COPYING
            patching file gzip.c

    2.3. rsync

        cd rsync-3.1.0
        patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/rsync-3.1.0.patch

            patching file COPYING
            patching file flist.c
            patching file generator.c
            patching file options.c
            patching file receiver.c
            patching file rsync.h
            patching file syscall.c
            patching file util.c

    2.4. tar

        cd tar-1.27.1
        patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/tar-1.27.1.patch

            patching file COPYING
            patching file lib/rmt.h
            patching file src/common.h
            patching file src/create.c
            patching file src/extract.c
            patching file src/list.c
            patching file src/names.c
            patching file src/sparse.c
            patching file src/system.c
            patching file src/tar.c


3. Installation

    To enable the Retools modifications, you must set CFLAGS to
    include "-DHAVE_LIBLUSTREAPI" and LIBS to include "-llustreapi"
    before configure and/or make.  For example, in bash syntax, the
    appropriate settings would be:

        export CFLAGS="-g -O2 -DHAVE_LIBLUSTREAPI"
        export LIBS="-llustreapi"

    To enable hashing functionality within tar, you must set CFLAGS to
    include "-DHAVE_LIBGCRYPT" and LIBS to include "-lgpg-error
    -lgcrypt".  For example, in bash syntax, to include all
    modifications, the appropriate settings would be:

        export CFLAGS="-g -O2 -DHAVE_LIBLUSTREAPI -DHAVE_LIBGCRYPT"
        export LIBS="-llustreapi -lgpg-error -lgcrypt"

    Copy the resulting executables to their final location.  It is
    recommended that these executables overwrite the standard system
    versions so users will get striping benefits by default.  In this
    case, copy as shown below (note that your destination paths may
    differ from those shown):

        cp bzip-1.0.6/bzip2 /usr/bin
        cp bzip-1.0.6/bzip2 /usr/bin/bunzip2
        cp gzip-1.6/gzip /usr/bin
        cp gzip-1.6/gzip /usr/bin/gunzip
        cp rsync-3.1.0/rsync /usr/bin
        cp tar-1.27.1/src/tar /bin

    Note that bunzip2 is a renamed bzip2 and gunzip is a renamed gzip.
    Do not use the gunzip shell wrapper that is created during the gzip
    build.

    If you do not wish to overwrite the standard versions, you must
    rename the executables to something else.  In this case, copy as
    shown below (which uses an "m" prefix for each executable) to your
    desired path (/usr/local/bin shown):

        cp bzip-1.0.6/bzip2 /usr/local/bin/mbzip2
        cp bzip-1.0.6/bzip2 /usr/local/bin/mbunzip2
        cp gzip-1.6/gzip /usr/local/bin/mgzip
        cp gzip-1.6/gzip /usr/local/bin/mgunzip
        cp rsync-3.1.0/rsync /usr/local/bin/mrsync
        cp tar-1.27.1/src/tar /usr/local/bin/mtar

    Note that gzip will only uncompress when named gunzip or mgunzip.
